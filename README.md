# Manual Testing Project – UNO by RateGain

## Project Overview

This repository contains a **manual testing project** completed as part of my software testing training. The project focuses on testing a web-based application called **UNO by RateGain**, with the aim of ensuring its functionality, usability, and overall reliability.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to identify functional and UI-related issues in the application and ensure that all features work as expected under different scenarios.

## Project Scope

* The application was divided into multiple **functional modules** for effective testing.
* Each module was tested independently to ensure complete coverage.

## Testing Activities Performed

* Created **detailed test cases** for each module, covering both **positive and negative scenarios**.
* Executed all test cases and clearly documented the **test execution results**.
* Identified defects during testing and logged **bug reports** with the following details:

  * Severity and Priority
  * Steps to Reproduce
  * Expected Result
  * Actual Result
* Prepared a **defect distribution graph** to analyze defects based on:

  * Severity levels
  * Module-wise distribution

## Deliverables

* Test Case Documents
* Bug Reports
* Defect Distribution Analysis

## Outcome

This project helped in improving the quality and stability of the application by identifying critical issues early and provided clear insights into defect trends through analysis.

## Tools Used

* Manual Testing Techniques
* Browser Developer Tools
* MS Excel (Test cases, defect tracking, and defect analysis)
