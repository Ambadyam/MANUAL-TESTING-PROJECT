# MANUAL-TESTING-PROJECT
As part of my software testing training, I worked on a manual testing project for a web-based application called UNO by RateGain. The objective of this project was to ensure the functionality, usability, and reliability of the application.
In this project, I divided the website into different modules and wrote detailed test cases for each module, including both positive and negative scenarios. I executed the test cases and documented the results clearly.
Whenever issues were identified, I prepared bug reports with proper details such as severity, priority, steps to reproduce, expected result, and actual result. I also created a defect distribution graph to analyze the defects based on severity and module-wise distribution.
